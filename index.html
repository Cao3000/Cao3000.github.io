<p>This project simulates an escape room in a VR environment. An escape room is a series of puzzles that one must solve to escape a room. The puzzles that need to be solved utilise objects inside the room. The puzzles will also give a player with key tools and hints to solve future puzzles. An escape room in real life requires a lot of interaction with the objects inside the room. Given the amount of interaction that is required, being able to use VR as opposed to a normal desktop app is advantageous as it would provide a more immersive experience as well as opening up new possibilities for interaction that would not be available on a desktop</p>
